action_mask.py — Shared mask for training and inference
====================================================================
Determins if an action is legal or not. Added so that the model will only make legal moes
Imported by model.py (training loop) and protoss_bot.py (inference).

Applying the same mask in both places ensures the model learns to
distribute probability only over legal actions — so the conditional
probabilities are calibrated for exactly the distribution seen at runtime.
