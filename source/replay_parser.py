replay_parser.py — Queued-Action Fixed-Grid Sequence Dataset Builder
=====================================================================
[unchanged header — see original for full docstring]

Changes in this version
-----------------------
- Removed probe_queue_ok from _action_legal_numpy. The queue-cap check is
  correct at inference time but wrong for parsing: the parser's pending probe
  count drifts upward over long games because cancelled/lost probes don't
  always fire UnitBornEvent to decrement the counter. This was silently
  demoting dozens of valid probe-train labels per replay.

- Added 1-of-building caps for CYBERNETICSCORE, TWILIGHTCOUNCIL, FLEETBEACON,
  TEMPLARARCHIVE. Pros never build a second of these. Capping the mask here
  prevents the model from ever learning to build duplicates, and also avoids
  the (rare) human duplicate build from polluting training labels.

- _IDX_SHIELDBATTERY added (was missing, causing index offset comment confusion).

    """
    Pure-numpy mirror of action_mask.build_legal_mask for a single obs vector,
    with PARSER-SPECIFIC relaxations to avoid false conflict demotions.

    Key differences from the inference mask (action_mask.py):
    ----------------------------------------------------------------
    1. probe_queue_ok is NOT checked. The parser's pending probe count drifts
       over long games causing false-illegal calls on valid probe trains.

    2. Prerequisite structure checks use PENDING-OR-COMPLETE rather than
       COMPLETE-ONLY. Pro players queue the next building the moment the
       prerequisite is placed (not when it finishes, ~60s later). The window
       snapshot is taken at the START of the window, so a gateway placed at
       t=128s won't appear as completed until t~190s. Using pending-or-complete
       means "the player has committed to building this" which is the right
       semantic for parsing intent.

       This affects: build_cyberneticscore (needs gateway), train_adept/stalker
       (needs cybcore), warp_in_stalker (needs warpgate), train_immortal (needs
       robo), train_voidray (needs stargate), and the entire tech tree chain.

    3. 1-of building caps are applied (same as inference mask): cybercore,
       twilight council, fleet beacon, templar archive. Pros never build
       duplicates — any such label in a replay is noise.

    4. Idle building checks are REMOVED for unit training actions. The parser's
       idle counts (indices 52-55) are derived from pending_units which drift
       for the same reason as pending probes. A pro training a stalker is valid
       if a gateway is pending-or-complete + cybcore is pending-or-complete,
       regardless of what the idle count says at snapshot time.

    The inference mask keeps all strict checks because the bot must actually
    be able to execute the action right now.
