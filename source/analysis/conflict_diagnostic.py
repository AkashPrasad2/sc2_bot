"""
conflict_diagnostic.py
======================
Runs the full mask/label conflict check on the parsed dataset and prints
exactly which (action_id, missing_prerequisite) pairs are causing conflicts.

Run this from the source directory:
    python conflict_diagnostic.py

This tells you precisely where the numpy mask in replay_parser.py and
the PyTorch mask in action_mask.py are disagreeing.
