"""
compare_replay_to_dataset.py - Comprehensive analysis of replay parsing

This script shows exactly what happens when a replay is parsed into training data:
- Which abilities are mapped to training actions
- Which abilities are ignored (unmapped)
- How actions are queued into 4-second windows
- What conflicts occur (actions illegal at snapshot time)
- Final action distribution in the training data
